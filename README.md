# Donations-Portal
The Donations Portal is a web app that connects donors, admins, and recipients. Donors can support causes like education or food, track requests, and get email updates. Recipients submit verified help requests, and admins approve and publish them. Queries are also handled via the portal and email, ensuring transparency.
